# 2D FEM Electrostatics

## Projects
- ``es_planar``: Planar electrostatics of a parallel-plate configuration
- Field enhancement (derived from COMSOL project of ET4103). Simulated using Gridap, most are in cylindrical coordinates.
  -  ``fieldenh_semicylinder``: Field enhancement at a semi-cylindrical protrusion
  -  ``fieldenh_hemisphere``: Field enhancement at a spherical protrusion
  -  ``fieldenh_sphere``: Field enhancement in a spherical cavity
  -  ``fieldenh_cylinder``: Field enhancement in a cylindrical cavity

## File extensions
- ``.ipynb``: Julia notebook
- ``.msh``: gmsh model file
- ``.vtu``: VTK file for visualisation of the results in ParaView
